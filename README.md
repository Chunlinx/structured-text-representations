# stuctured-text-representations
Pytorch implementation of : "Learning Structured Text Representations"

1. Dataset Instructions : https://github.com/nlpyang/structured
2. Preprocessing code has been borowed from : https://github.com/nlpyang/structured
3. We use https://github.com/andersjo/dependency_decoding for chu_liu_edmonds algorithm

This code by default requires Pytorch Nightly version (For batched inverse)
To run with Pytorch stabe use --pytorch_version stable

Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt
