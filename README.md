# stuctured-text-representations

Pytorch implementation of : 
[Learning Structured Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09207)  
Yang Liu and Mirella Lapata,
Accepted by TACL

1. Dataset Instructions : https://github.com/nlpyang/structured
2. Pre-processing code has been borrowed from : https://github.com/nlpyang/structured
3. We use https://github.com/andersjo/dependency_decoding for chu_liu_edmonds algorithm

4. This code by default requires Pytorch Nightly version (For batched inverse).
5. To run with Pytorch stable use --pytorch_version stable

6. Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.
7. Create dir saved_models before running
